# UKAEA-PMP1
UKAEA Project Management Phase 1
UKAEA Blended Practical Project Management Phase 1
Introduction


What is Behind This Workshop?

So, how did this workshop evolve?

Some years ago, the Authority decided to adopt a specific method for the delivery of its projects. They chose the method sponsored by apm (the Association of Project Managers) and produced an integrated framework that covered the whole of the Culham site – IDP – within which to deliver projects under the apm method.

The method is supported by the APM Body of Knowledge (APMBoK) in which you will find all the necessary tools and techniques for running your projects.

However, IDP and the APMBoK alone required a little embellishment to create a cohesive delivery approach and therefore some best management practice is also blended into the mix.

This gives us the Practical Project Management workshop we have today. However, there is nothing in what we cover that flies in the face of any accreditation that you may wish to take in the future and can be supported by a number of other technique workshops if you so desire.


The World of Projects

So, let us investigate the intriguing world of projects and see if we can recognize areas that might have caused problems in the past and thereby learn how to deal with them in the future.


What is a “Project” Anyway? 1

Right, let’s get started by asking a simple question…What is a project?

It is many things but one thing it is NOT, is business as usual (BAU).

BAU is the daily turning of the handle in order to keep the business or organization running smoothly. For example, processing supplier invoices; processing orders; dealing with candidates for job interviews…and the list goes on.

Projects bring CHANGE to BAU.


What is a “Project” Anyway?

Here's the definition of both a project and project management as found in the APMBoK...

“Unique, transient endeavour undertaken to achieve planned objectives”*

“…the application of processes, methods, knowledge, skills and experience to achieve the project objectives”*



A Project has the Following:

Now that we know a project is not BAU, what are its attributes that make it so different?

Click on each box for more information
A finite and defined life span:
A project will have a specific start and an end so that it doesn’t just wander on aimlessly.

Defined and measurable business products:
It will produce a set of defined business products or services which must have some quality criteria wrapped around them so that we know when they are complete and acceptable.

A set of activities to achieve these:
In order to achieve the delivery of these business products or services, it will require a number of tasks or activities to be scheduled within the boundaries of the project.

A defined amount of resources:
Those activities or tasks will require a defined amount of resource, whether human, financial, plant & machinery or other technological resources.

An organisation structure:
And finally, the project needs to be both directed according to the business strategy as well as managed on a day to day basis – hence it needs its own organization structure.



Managing Projects for Value

If our project is to get off the ground, it must be beneficial to the organisation, which means it must be driven by a business case. A business case that aligns with strategic objectives and delivers a benefit that outweighs its costs and risks.

In the past, our traditional approach to managing projects focused solely on the ”iron triangle” of Time, Cost & Quality. These are absolutely the right things to measure but don’t really open the project manager’s mind to the broader aspects of the rationale of the project. Therefore we should now look at adding three other aspects of project control to provide a more rounded approach – risk, scope and benefits.

With all six aspects in focus we can now not only deliver what has been specified but also check the project remains valid and has a continued business justification.

Generic Product Life Span

Where does a project ‘sit’ in the grand scheme of things that are going on in an organization?

If we look at a generic lifecycle of a product, we see that it starts with an idea, moves into a study to see if it is useful or feasible, then on to trigger the change.

It is at this point that the product owner or sponsor hands over the day to day management of the project to a project manager whilst they continue with their day to day management of their business function.

The project manager takes over the idea and through using a defined set of resources with technical skills, leads them through specification, design, development, testing and eventually to hand-over/change over

At this point the project is closed and the business takes back control and every now and then will assess the product or service for fitness for purpose. If it is still fine, they continue its use, if not, they may scrap it.

You will notice that although the sponsor hands over to the project manager, they DO NOT relinquish ACCOUNTABILITY for their project.

UKAEA Lifecycle - IDP

In order for the Authority to deliver projects in a uniform way, the Integrated Delivery Process was constructed. It was recognised from an appreciative enquiry that there were many hot spots of good practice which were to be nurtured and subsumed into the IDP lifecycle. Therefore a a set of procedures were put together with some useful tools and techniques to help project managers get to grips with their projects in a coherent and consistent way across the Culham site. A major aspect of IDP is that there is transparency as to which projects should be attempted and once chosen, which tailored version of the lifecycle would best fit the project. Therefore the Authority could ensure the scarce resources of money and people were directed to the right projects to be done in the right way.

I have not heard any complaints thus far about IDP being bureaucratic or too rigid, so I am hopeful that it will become embedded as the de facto approach to project delivery at Culham Science Centre. 

UKAEA Lifecycle - IDP (Integrated Delivery Process)
IDP is:
An initiative to align the many good practices across the Culham site.
A useful set of procedures, guidelines and tools that will streamline the way we do projects and deliver work packages.
An approach to delivering the right projects in the right way.

What it is not:
A new raft of rules and documents requiring lots of signatures.
A rigid system that must be followed by allat all times.


IDP Lifecycle Generic

    Red diamonds are Gate reviews held by the sponsoring entity i.e. programme board or project board.
    Orange diamondsare Interim Reviews internal to the project.
    Evidence from Interim Reviews inform the Gate reviews.
    The benefits resulting from the work must be realised and measurable.


IDP Lifecycle Generic Continued

Some of you may have seen an IDP lifecycle before but for those who haven't let me point out some simple features:

There are four basic processes:

Justification

Definition

Solution Delivery

Deliver the Output & Close

Solution Delivery may well be broken down into stages or phases in accordance with the style and delivery of the project.

There is also a final process ' Benefits Realisation' where the benefits defined in the business case should be tracked, measured and reported to substantiate that the project was warranted in the first place.

The diamonds are decision or review points, which happen throughout the project. The red ones are project board Go/No Go decisions points and the orange ones are interim or technical reviews, the output of which help support project board decisions at the Gate reviews.


Project Life Cycle 1

In order for the project to progress through the Gate reviews, evidence of it being worthwhile and viable are required.

Therefore, at the end of Justification there should be a reasonable business case presented to the project board for them to assess if there is business justification for the project to progress into Definition.

By the end of the detailed planning of Definition, the project board will be presented with the Project Management Plan. This contains all the detail needed to decide whether to continue with the project...or not.

During Solution Delivery there may well be a number of stage end reviews and sign-offs required to ensure the project remains viable and warranted.

Finally, after Handover and Project Close, there will be a last review to close the project and agree the timetable to measure the benefits.

Justification - Business Case.
Definition - Project Management Plan.
Solution Delivery - Reviews & Stage Sign-offs.
Handover and project close


Genesis of the Project Information

Where does the project information come from?

Initially, a Project Justification Document is created to gather the customer or user requirements and ensure the project manager has a ’meeting of minds’ as to what is to be delivered, by when and what might be the customer’s quality expectations.

This will lead to an outline business case being put together based on what is known at the time.

Eventually, the whole composite set of project information is gathered under the Project Management Plan by the end of definition.

There is nowhere that states you can’t use copy and paste in these evolving documents! If there is a succinct paragraph that describes the project and is understood by all parties, then let it flow through the documents so that a consistent view is held by one and all.


Project Management Methodology & Framework

Any methodology or framework will require tailoring to the type, complexity, risk and prominence of the individual project.

There will always be a basic structure to any framework that should provide for the simpler projects. However, the more complex or risky the project, the more support from the framework is required. Adding features or increasing the amount of the framework for specific projects may well require discussion with the Project Management Office (PMO) who are set up to help project managers identify the right level of control for their projects and their own abilities or experience.


Governance Framework 1

A straightforward framework, like that of IDP, will help the project manager to divide up the project into ‘chunks’ where questions need to asked by the Project Board and decisions required such as those noted here.


Governance Framework 2

Within that framework we have already discovered that the Solution Delivery process may be broken down into management stages. These management stages may be budgetary 'buckets' of project spend at the end of which a decision is required to proceed into the next stage and funding is then allocated to the project manager for the upcoming stage.

In order to keep the project running in a sensible and logical way, those stages might be further broken down into technical phases. These may overlap the management stages, as demonstrated here.

Taking the first management stage as an example, the funding for that stage will cover all the tasks required to complete Contract Negotiations, Overall Design, half of Layout Desigh and half of Systems Design. At which point, in this particular project, a decision is required to progress into stage two.


Why are Stages Important?

Dividing up a project into management stages is important for a number of reasons:

    It acts like a 'firebreak' to ensure the project only spends as much as has been allocated to it at any one time. This stops the project burning through the whole of the budget too early.
    It provides specific decision points where the project board members might want to review the project before progressing into the next stage.
    There may be particular contract or payment points which must be observed before continuing.
    How far into the future can you plan with any certainty? Nowadays, with the speed of change in technology, it is difficult to see much beyond three months with clarity.  So plan what you can 'see' into the next stage.
    An important consideration is team motivation. Don't plan your stage too long as the team needs a target.  Make it slightly 'up hill' but not so much as to be impossible to achieve. Then celebrate the success of completing the stage.


The Project Justification Document

When a project is conceived, the initial information must be captured somewhere.

It is the Project Justification Document (PJD) that holds the early iterations of that information.  The template for this document can be found in the Integrated delivery Process pages of the Nucleus intranet.


Business Case; Cost Versus Value

The justification for any project is based on it having a sound business case, which is part of the reason for completing a PJD. The Authority will need to understand the benefits of the initiative as well as the costs, risks and any negative effects in order to decided whether to authorise the project.

Benefits are positive effects of the project whereas dis-benefits are negative effects. Dis-benefits are NOT risks as they are ‘known’ effects which will only come about if the project is run.

There are usually financial and non-financial benefits associated with a project and both need to be considered to gain a rounded view of the project. It is obvious that financial benefits represent value for money but less so with non-financial benefits, which also represent value for money in a different sense. For example, improving the working environment will cost money and may not provide a direct financial benefit. However, the new working conditions may improve staff morale and teamwork, as well as reduce sick days and therefore increase productivity, thus providing value for money from the project.



Benefits are measurable improvements perceived as positive by one or more stakeholders… 

…both financial and non-financial…

…and represent value for money


Examples of Benefit Types

There are many different types of benefit, as you see listed here, of which some are financial and some non-financial.

Two interesting benefits are ‘Experimental’ of which you are all aware and ‘Management information as an enabler’, which may seem odd. However, if the organisation does not have sufficient management information to make informed decisions, the future of the organisation will be left to guess-work. Running a project to provide more effective management information will be of huge benefit for the future of the organisation and its staff.


Examples of Benefit Types:

    Cost Avoidance
    Additional Income
    New Income
    Strategic alignment
    Competitive advantage or response
    Experimental
    Management information as an enabler
    Risk reduction
    Increased productivity
    Workforce satisfaction
    Customer service
    Customer image


Measuring & Comparing Benefits

Many non-financial benefits are associated with a financial impact through proxy measures and when combined with the financial benefits of the project, provide input to a graph such as the Net Benefit Graph. 

This demonstrates how much benefit is expected (in green) against the cost of delivering that benefit (in red) and when the cost is netted-off against the value, we see a Net Benefit Line (in blue) showing when we expect to observe a positive outcome.

We find effective ways of measuring and comparing benefits, to underpin the assessment of value for money.


Project Justification Document

So, who gets involved in putting together the PJD?

The Project Sponsor who owns the project will have an amount of information to provide for the PJD such as the context and background as well as the expected benefits, business risks and any potential timeframe.

The Project manager will undoubtedly be the ‘keyboard player’ in completing the PJD on behalf of the Sponsor. They will be able to assess the costs and potential technical risks.

But don’t stop there! Both within and beyond the boundary of your project there are stakeholders who may have vital information that could be vital to the PJD at this early stage. This information may assist a ‘useful’ project in gaining authorization to proceed or highlight problems that may prevent a ‘poor’ project from being started. Cast your stakeholder net wide to include as much information in the PJD as you can, to ensure the right projects are authorized.

    Who is involved…

–Project Sponsor – the owner

–Project Manager – the development?

–Stakeholders – other information about the project.


Project Justification Document…content:

    Executive Summary
    Strategic Fit
    Options Appraisal
    Commercial Aspects
    Affordability
    Achievability 

For each of these, the business case needs to be considered at each level…Initial, Outline & Full.

If you obtain a copy of the PJD you will see the content that needs to be completed. The executive committee, who will receive the PJD do not have time to read every word in the document. Therefore, an executive summary is essential, especially with very large projects. The detail will follow in the subsequent sections.

Strategic fit – This section explains how the project fits with the strategy of the organization and if so, which strategic objective(s) it supports

Options appraisal – Here we will set out the various options for delivering the end solution and outcomes with a recommended option. There will be one option that is always included – the ‘Do Nothing’ option against which we can measure the other options.

Commercial aspects – If the project is to purchase products and services during its lifecycle, the organization needs to understand the commercial requirements and what resource may be required to support those aspects. Of course, there is also the commercial aspects of selling the project outputs and services which should not be overlooked.

Affordability – Can the organization afford to do the project (in financial and phasing terms). This is the start of the business case for the project, of which there will be three – the Initial Business Case (created prior to the PJD), the Outline Business Case and the Full Business Case.

Achievability – Is it possible to achieve the outcomes and what constitutes a successful project. What are the critical success factors against the scope of the project and does the organization have the capacity and capability to deliver the project.



Modelling & Evaluation:

…modelling is essential…make sure you don’t have a ‘spurious’ accuracy…

    Good, Average, Poor performance scenarios
    Probability of benefits*
    Sensitivity on costs*
    Optimism bias*
    Risk probability & costs of mitigation.

*Stephen Jenner – Managing Benefits

Having completed the PJD it will need ‘shaking’ to ensure it is based on sense and a degree of accuracy pertinent to the amount of information available at the time.

The decision makers will need to see an estimate of a Good, Average and Poor outcome to assess the validity of the project along with a probability of obtaining the benefits; an understanding as to the sensitivity of any cost elements (some will be more sensitive to price rises that others – e.g. metals); and whether there is any optimism bias associated with the benefit values. Humans are eternally optimistic when it comes to quantifying benefits.

The figures may indicate that the project is worth doing but the risks and costs of mitigating them may be prohibitive. Therefore, it is is important to include a view of the major or key risks.

Finally, should you be interested in any further reading on the subject of benefits management, Stephen Jenner is the author of some very useful texts.

Project Organisation:

Organisation:

This is the APMBoK definition of a project organisation.
format_quote

Organisation is the management structure applicable to the project, programme or portfolio and the organisational environment in which it operates.


Organisation Structure

Every project requires a temporary organization, which focuses on the project and its environment and sets out the reporting structure and hierarchy for decision-making and how this will effect the project management of the initiative.

    This is the organisational environment within which the project takes place.
    It defines the reporting and decision making hierarchy of an organisation and how project management operates within that structure.


Why do we Need Structure?

This is talking about structure in any organisation, not just within a project. Although a project has a much more focused set of stakeholders than the whole organisation:

    Reporting 
    Relationships 
    Authority
    Responsibility and accountability
    Personal loyalties
    Communications


Key Stakeholder Groups

Basically there are three major stakeholder groups that have an interest in the project:

The business – represented by the project sponsor – has quite a clinical interest in the project. It is all about the money – the funding and spend as well as the benefits to be derived from the project

The User community – represented by the users or customers – have a different view of the project. It is all about whether the overall solution will meet their needs and will therefore drive out the benefits on behalf of the sponsor

The suppliers – represented by both internal resource suppliers as well as external ones – have a still different view. For them it is all about whether the resources they are providing have the right skills, qualifications and abilities to deliver the products and services to the quality specified by the users

All these interests must be considered throughout the project as they all have input to the direction of the project.


The Roles:

    Project Board/Executive Committee
    Project Sponsor
    User Representative(s)
    Supplier Representative(s)
    Project Manager
    Project Assurance
    Work Package Manager(s)
    Project Management Office (PMO)

The Roles within the three stakeholder groups are:

    Project Board or Executive Committee – responsible for directing the project, keeping it aligned with strategy and making decisions on significant changes.
    Project Sponsor – owns the business case and is accountable for successful project delivery - i.e. delivering the benefits stated in the business case.
    User Representatives – provide the project with their requirements and acceptance criteria as well as any user resources needed by the project.
    Supplier Representatives – provide the project with resources to deliver the outputs (human, plant, machinery, materials and services).
    Project Manager – runs the project on a day-to-day basis on behalf of the Sponsor.
    Project Assurance – ensures the project is being run in accordance with any approaches agreed between the Project Board and the Project Manager.
    Work Package Managers (aka Team Manager) – are responsible for delivering the outputs of the project on behalf of the Project Manager.
    The PMO – responsible for the UKAEA PM procedures, policies and templates as well as establishing & sharing best practice, providing oversight & consistency for PM skills and competencies

Controlled Start: Justification and Definition

Projects need to start with the end in mind, be linked to a strategic objective and have a solid business rationale as to why the project should proceed.

The first two processes in IDP are there to ensure this happens for every project.


Taking Aim

In the Justification process, the project is proposed and assessed at portfolio level as to when (and whether) the organization wishes it to be delivered. Once it has the go-ahead, it will be passed to the Sponsor and a Project Manager who will draw together as much information as possible in the Project Justification Document. This is then presented for approval and authorization to proceed into the Definition stage.
Propose project
Appoint project manager
Develop project justification document
Propose project launch


During Definition, a much more detailed investigation takes place which will include more stakeholders so that a richer picture of the project as a whole can be developed. This information is gathered in the Project Management Plan so that the project board may approve the project and the various resource providers may start to assemble the project team.
Develop project management plan
Approve project implementation
Appoint project team


The Project Justification Document and the Project Management Plan

In order to justify a project there has to be a reason to do the project in the first place.

The trigger that starts our project processes is the Project Justification Document.

The document that contains all the detail and the project plan is the Project Management Plan.


Balancing the Positives & Negatives

Both documents try to balance out the positives and negatives for executing the project by answering the following:

    Is there an actual business need and if so, what are the perceived outcomes and scope of the project?
    Does the project fit with the business strategy and link with an organizational objective?
    Have we looked at a number of possible options to deliver the outcomes we want and if so, do we have a preferred option?
    Have we considered all the commercial aspects of the project and gathered the right information from our commercial and legal departments?
    Can we afford to do the project right now?  OR can we not afford to do it right now? This may be a financial question but it should not be overlooked that there are other reasons to run projects!
    If we do decide to run the project, is it achievable with the other initiatives already running, the resources already committed and the technical viability of the venture?


The Business Case

    The reason or justification for the project
    Three levels of detail:

– Initial Business Case

– Outline Business Case

– Full Business Case

    Detail built-up across the PJD and the PMP.

Ultimately it is down to the business justification and viability as to whether the project is desirable and worthwhile.

It is the business case that justifies the project and will be built-up as more details emerge during Justification and Definition.

That is why there are three levels of business case - Initial, Outline and Full.

But it all starts in Justification where the initial business case is included in the Project Justification Document.



Project Management Plan…Content 1

1. Introduction

1) Provides an overview of what the project will deliver and briefly describes how the project will be be executed.

2. What is being delivered

1) Principal requirements definition.

2) Project scope definition.

3) Project schedule and milestones.

3. Who is instrumental in realising success

1) Stakeholders, internal & external.

2) People Department requirements.

These are the first three sections of the Project Management Plan (PMP) which cover an introduction, an overview of the requirements and therefore the scope, as well as a project level plan with specific milestones. This plan will not be completed until all the sections of the PMP have been completed because activities and costs will emerge as each section comes under investigation.

Section three covers leadership, stakeholder engagement and communication as well as defining the human resources that will be required to analyse, design, develop and implement the project.


Project Management Plan…Content 2

4. How the project will be executed

1) Design phase execution plan.

2) Development of the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

3) Cost estimate summary.

4) Communication management.

5) Commercial strategy.

6) Project information.

7) Management of realisation activities.

Section 4 is all about project execution and how it will be managed.

Lower level plans are required for the various stages/phases of the project where more detailed information concerning the outputs will be developed, leading to a more detailed cost breakdown structure.

It is now that we need to look back at our list of stakeholders and work out how and when we will carry out our communications with them as well as ensuring that anything we intend to purchase involves the commercial and procurement teams.

Projects generate quite a lot of information (the Justification and PMP documents are just the start) and therefore we need to consider what our information management approach should be and how we maintain the information.

Having started with the end in mind, we ought to ensure those who will manage the implementation and realisation tasks are prepared for when those tasks are scheduled.


Project Management Plan…Content 3

5. Project Success Assurance

1) Achievability.

2) Constraints, Assumptions & Exclusions.

3) Project Change Management Process.

4) Risk Management.

5) Quality Management.

6) Safety, Health & Environment (SHE) Planning.

7) Project Monitoring and Control.

8) Interface Management.

9) Project Completion and Acceptance Criteria.

10) Benefits Management.

Finally, section 5 is concerned with the level of control that will be required of the project. In order to do this, the team will need to understand the factors that may impact the ability to achieve the project objectives, including such things as any Constraints, Assumptions & Exclusions as these will require controls placed around them to ensure minimum impact on the project.

There are strategies for various other aspects of the project that will need to be documented so that the team adopts consistent and standard approaches, such as:

    How requests for change are to be handled
    How we will analyse and manage risks
    How we will ensure we adhere to the right level of quality
    How we will ensure the Safety, Health & Environment (SHE) factors are overseen and that no harm comes to anyone
    What sort of monitoring and control will be needed for this specific project.  Is it highly complex and risky - in which case a much more formal approach will be needed, or is it a small self-contained piece of work in which case a lighter touch may be more appropriate
    How we will identify and maintain any interfaces that our project will encounter - such as interfaces with other projects; current products in operation; other technologies; interfaces within our own project
    How do we know what 'complete' looks like and who should approve the completion of the project

Finally, we must ensure that once the project has been closed, the benefits are realised on behalf of the organisation. This will not be part of the project team's role, however the sponsor will need to understand how and when to measure the benefits.


Project Management Plan…Review

    Board Meetings.
    End of stages/phases.
    Issue management / Requests For Change.
    Programme level reviews.
    Project Closure.
    Benefits Realisation.

Once the PMP has been approved, it should not be considered a 'static' document that gets put on the shelf and forgotten. It will require periodic updates and review during progress meetings with the project board and at the end of each stage/phase to gain authorization to progress to the next stage.

The PMP will need to be reviewed where there are significant risks, issues or requests for change that may well impact on the schedule or quality of the outputs.

If the project is part of a programme, there will be reviews with the programme manager, who will want to look over the current version of the PMP with the project manager.

And finally, the current version of the PMP will be evaluated at closure against the initial PMP for both statistical purposes and to see if any lessons may be learned from the experience.

Post-project, the benefits management section of the PMP will be evaluated once the benefits realization activities are underway and at their completion.


Plans and Planning

Is planning a mystic art...or is it more scientific than that?

Well, it's a bit of both. There are some things that you may be able to estimate and plan because you (or another project manager) has encountered them before. However, there's a lot of unknowns in most projects where a best guesstimation is required – usually through discussion with others.


What is a Plan?

What should it contain?

A plan is NOT a Gantt chart. A Gantt chart is a pictorial representation of the schedule of tasks and milestones of the project - a plan is much more than it's Gantt.

It should contain words! Maybe the odd picture or graph to illustrate a point. Probably an organisation chart and a cash flow forecast.

It should describe the area of the project that it covers and what will be delivered by the plan.

It should mention any constraints, assumptions and exclusions - along with their associated risks and issues.


Benefits of Planning

    Helps avoid muddle & "ad hoc'ery".
    Opportunity to pre-think future action.
    Provides targets.
    Confirms targets are achievable before start.
    Communicates intentions.
    Gains commitment.
    Yardstick for progress measurement.

Why do we want to plan in the first place?

It gives us a chance to pre-think what needs to be done and provide the stakeholders with target dates and deliveries.

If the project manager plans with their team, the targets will be decided by mutual agreement and therefore be more achievable.

A plan is a communication device that sets out the intentions of the next part of the project and in doing so, is part of the ‘contract’ between the project manager and the resource suppliers who commit those resources required to deliver the plan.

Lastly, if you haven’t got a map – you don’t know where you are. The plan is the map for the project or stage and the achievement is the journey you can plot across the plan to see where you are.


Planning Principles

    Start with the end in mind.
    Plan activities when the product or outcome is understood.
    Produce a project level Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and high level project plan.
    Decide how far ahead it is sensible to do detailed WBS planning e.g.

    stage by stage.
    iteration by iteration.

There are four simple principles to planning:

    Always start with the end in mind and then you can assess the achievability of the venture.
    Once you have understood the next stage/phase and the outputs, you can put a plan together to deliver them.
    Break the project into its high level outputs so that you can construct a logical flow of delivery.
    Break the project into stages/phases to concentrate management over shorter periods of time leading to the delivery of outputs or milestones.


Breakdown Structures

We use breakdown structures to demonstrate the hierarchical relationships between various elements. In a project, the breakdown structures allow us to group elements into product types or workstreams – hence the Product Breakdown Structure (PBS from the PRINCE2® method) and Work Breakdown Structures (WBS) which are common to all project methods. 

Once the products of the project have been identified and the work has been broken down, we can then produce a Cost Breakdown Structure (CBS) for the project. The CBS lends itself to assisting with creating the project budget and once the work has been planned, a cost forecast over time.

    Hierarchical structures enabling the scope of the project to be broken down into its component parts

    Examples:

– Product (PRINCE2®)

– Work

– Cost


Work Breakdown Structure: WBS

The WBS is about activities and not products and is usually depicted in a graphical tree format with a numbering system that provides a unique reference to each piece of work. Although we concentrate on the development work, we must not forget all the other activities that will form the whole of the project’s work.

At this point we have a ‘shopping list’ of activities with relationships that denote they are contained withing a workstream. What we do not have is a schedule where the dependency relationship occur.

    Hierarchical list of project’s work activities
    2 Formats 

– Outline (indented format)

– Graphical Tree (Organizational Chart)

    Uses a decimal numbering system

– Ex: 3.1.5

– 0 is typically top level

    Includes

– Development, management, support; quality, communication, financial & legal tasks

    Shows “is contained in” relationships
    Does not show dependencies or durations.

WBS Guidelines

These guidelines are fairly obvious, but they are worth noting and remembering when developing the WBS.

    Should be easy to understand
    Some organizations have corporate standards for these schemes
    Some top-level items, like Project Mgmt. are in the WBS for every project

– Others vary by project

    What often hurts most is what’s missing 
    Break down until you can generate accurate time & cost estimates
    Ensure each element corresponds to a deliverable



Work Package

A Work Package is then developed from the WBS to provide information to the developer or technician about the product(s) they are to complete.  It comes from the PM as much as an instruction to the developer as it is a way of delegating responsibility for the work.

The work package will be developed from any of the breakdown structures we have already mentioned as well as integrating information from other sources for completeness.

It is understandable that the content of a work package will differ between projects as they will all have different products and requirements but it should also be noted that each work package will differ from another as they will most likely be the input to different workstreams (e.g. electrical WPs will differ from IT WPs, which will differ from engineering WPs and so on…).


Work Package (typical content)

This is the typical content of the UKAEA structured Work Package, which is broken into 5 major sections:

    Header Information – seen here to cover the administrative aspects of the WP.
    Inputs required – these are the products or services on which this WP is dependent and need to be available for the work to be completed.
    Tasks to be performed – as the section suggests, these are the major tasks required to develop the products or services defined in the WP – especially the quality activities.
    WP Outputs – here the completed outputs are defined so that the PM is able to assess whether the products have been completed to plan, cost and quality and that approval has been gained from the user/beneficiary.
    Management information – covers the work order numbers for the the various cost categories to be utilised in the WP as well as the amount of resource required and finally the WP costs, broken down by resource type.

    Management Information:

− U4BW Work Order eg Staff, Purchases, Design Office, etc.

− Resources: eg Person days - Professional Staff, Technical, Staff, Support Staff, Others.

− Budget: eg  Labour, Purchases, JOC,  Art 7, etc.

− Total Budgeted Costs.

    Header Information:

− Project

− WP Title

− Contractor

− Start Event

− End Event

− WP Manager

− Sheet No.

− WP Ref

− Issue No.

− Planned Start Date

− Planned End Date

− Date

Solution Delivery 1:

This covers the day-to-day tasks of the project manager.

Solution Delivery 2:



    Review & Update Project Management Plan
    Phase Authorisation
    Control Work Packages
    Manage Resources
    Monitor & Update Schedule

Often considered as 'spinning plates' by many project managers, amongst these day to day tasks, there is a need to keep an eye on the PMP and gain authorisation to proceed into the next stage.

The main role of the project manager is to maintain control over the work that has been delegates in the work packages and manage the resource situation so that they can monitor the state of play and keep the schedule up to date.

Solution Delivery 3:



    Monitor & Update Costs
    Actively Manage Risks
    Undertake Change Control
    Complete the Project

Continuing with the plate spinning theme, the project manager will also be keeping an eye on the project costs, managing the risks and issues as well as controlling requests for change.

…and of course, completing the delivery of the outputs leading to the completion of the project.


Controlling Quality:

Quality is all about the products and services created by the project being fit for purpose.


Quality – What the Customer Specifies!

Quality Planning

– Preventative medicine

    Steps taken to increase likelihood of achieving quality

– Identify quality requirements & standards

– Document how to demonstrate compliance

Quality Control

– Curative medicine

    Steps taken to measure quality of the product and the management processes

– Discovers defects & proposes improvements

– Inspection, testing, reviews

Quality Assurance

– Corporate responsibility

– Checks for compliance

Let's break quality down into three areas:

Quality Planning

This is planning to deliver the right quality first time - as specified by the client, user or customer. This may also require adherence to standards, rules, regulations or even legal requirements. In most cases the project will need to demonstrate compliance with various requirements and this is done by documenting the quality criteria of each product.

Quality Control

Is the flip-side of Quality Planning, in that it is done after the product is built. Tests, checks, inspections, reviews are all part of the Quality Control regime. It does have one other feature...if defects are found, there must be a feedback loop to Quality Planning so that the defect can be eradicated next time round.

Quality Assurance

Is a department within the organization, usually reporting to the corporate level, which is responsible for ensuring compliance with standards, policies and regulations to ensure the organization as a whole remains in bounds with the regulatory bodies.


The World of Quality

From this picture you can see that Quality Assurance oversees all aspects of quality, some of which may well be associated with the project. Therefore it is wise to seek their input early in the project lifecycle to ensure we do not transgress!

Some of the areas they cover are:

The Quality Management System (a repository of standards, tools, techniques, templates and regulations which should, if used, ensure compliance for the organization.

Some external standards such as ISO, WEEE, Sarbanes Oxley (SOX), Internal compliance to process, Capability Development Model (CDM) and a Capability Maturity Model (CMM).


Controlling Risks

The purpose of Risk Management is to identify, assess and control uncertainty and as a result, improve the ability of the project to succeed.


A “Risk” is:

“An uncertain event that, should it occur, will have an impact on one or more objectives of a project”.

An issue is:

All projects encounter uncertainty – more so at the start and less so towards the end as the team gets to understand the objectives and outputs through the life of the project.

A risk therefore is:

It is an uncertain event or set of events that, should it occur, will have an effect on the achievement of objectives.

An issue therefore is:

It is any relevant event that has happened, was not planned and requires management action.



Risks vs Issues

    Risk - Proactive

– In the future.

– Uncertain.

– Need to evaluate Probability, Impact and Proximity.

– Time to plan – may or may not need to action.

– Possibly raised as a consequence of existing issue.

The confusion between issues and risks generally arises because a risk, if it materializes, will become an issue. In addition, some issues cause risks to be identified.

However, the way to assess whether something is a risk or an issue is to use these checks...

You need to be proactive with risks - always scanning the horizon for any potential threats or opportunities.

Whereas, with issues, you will need to evaluate them properly to see if they are urgent before rushing off to cure them.

    Issue - Reactive

– Here now. 

– A certainty. 

– Need to evaluate impact. 

– Urgency - needs immediate action. 

– Possibility of re-occurrence? – raise as a risk.



Risk Principles and Context

    Supported and promoted by Board.
    Policies & Framework communicated & consistent.
    Links with other projects, programmes.
    Risk tolerance – organisation’s appetite for risk.
    Project Manager manages the process.
    Risk Owners assigned.
    Risk mitigation – impact on Business Case.

When carrying out risk management, there are simple principles to bear in mind:

Risk management as a practice needs to be supported by senior management. This is not a problem within the Authority and nor is having a policy and framework which is consistent and well understood.

However, we must remember that we are not alone in our project work. There are other projects and programmes which may be impacted by a risk that we observe. This means you need to apply good communication with others who may be affected by the risk.

When you start a project, you need to understand the potential level of risk attached to that project and work out the risk tolerance (or appetite) that is appropriate. For instance a complex, high profile or safety critical project may require some in-depth risk analysis and management whereas a simple project deploying a new back-office process may warrant a more 'relaxed' attitude to risk.

As to who does what:

    The project sponsor agrees the risk appetite for the project and is accountable for the project having a risk management process.
    The project manager manages the risk management process.
    A risk owner provides specialist input and management of a specific risk.
    A risk actionee carries out the tasks to mitigate a risk, taking direction from the risk owner.

Finally, any mitigation will cost time and money. Therefore, the impact of these costs needs to be assessed against the project business case to confirm continued business justification in the project.



Risk Management Process

The Risk Management Process is a set of four steps supported by an approach.

We start with the approach (Initiate Risk Management) as this is how the project will address risks depending on its level of risk, complexity and profile. Recommended in Section 5 of the PMP by the project manager, the Risk Management Approach is agreed with the sponsor and project board at the outset of the project.

The approach will explain how the four steps of Identify, Assess, Plan Responses and Implement responses will be applied.

In the Identify step, it will set out the standard method of how and where we capture our risks and identify what they are and how they might impact our project.

It will define the levels to be used in the Assess step to set probability, impact and proximity for the identified risks.

It will also provide definitions of the responses to be used to mitigate the threats and opportunities when considering the actions to be taken during the Plan Responses step.

And finally, it will provide the project team with information as to how the mitigating actions will be implemented, checked and assessed as complete.



Plan Responses

    Threat:

– Avoid a threat.

– Reduce a threat.

– Transfer the risk.

– Share.

– Accept.

– Contingency.

    Opportunity:

– Exploit an opportunity.

– Enhance an opportunity .

– Share.

– Reject.

The responses that are available to the project team within the Plan Responses step fall into the two categories for Threats and Opportunities and these are as shown. More information as to what these represent and how they might be used is covered in the virtual course.


Controlling Issues:

Having dealt with risks, lets now look at issues.

These are slightly easier to deal with compared with risks as they are in the present and there is no uncertainty as to the impact.


Issue Management 1:


Issue Management 2:

The issue management process is quite straightforward.

A new issue is captured in the issue register at which point the issue reference is fed back to the author and any additional concerns or questions are asked and answered.

A priority and severity are allocated to the issue:

    The priority defines the urgency of correction.
    The severity refers to the level of management required to make a decision on the issue.

An impact analysis is then carried out to assess the issue and work out a resolution. The impact analysis should cover:

    The impact on project and stage level pans.
    Whether the issue or the resolution will take the project or stage outside its tolerances (particularly time and cost).
    The impact on resources.
    The impact on the business case.
    Whether any further risks will be spawned from either not correcting the issue or from its resolution activities.

If the issue can be dealt with inside the tolerances, the project manager may authorise the correction, update the issue register and confirm that the issue is closed with the author.

If not, the issue must be escalated to the project board under an exception report for a decision. NOTE: The issue resolution may be within tolerance but the severity may require it to be escalated to the project board.

At all times, the project manager must keep the issue register up-to-date as regards progress.


Tips for Dealing with Issues:

The first thing to do when an issue is raised is NOT to 'knee-jerk' into a solution but look at the issue objectively and assess the most appropriate course of action. This may well require technical views from the team.

Carry out the impact analysis - not forgetting the plans, risks and business case.

Take corrective action if it is within your remit so to do.

If not, escalate, letting the project board members know the urgency of the issue and therefore their decision.

Constant escalation indicates an unwillingness to act and inundates the project board with unnecessary work. Therefore the Authority reminds you that you are empowered to act!


Controlling Change:

Changes to the baseline product set of a project must be controlled in order to protect the quality of the final deliverable.

This is done through two techniques – 

Change Control and Configuration Management.



Business Case Change Control

Project failures come in all sorts of shapes and sizes. Failure to deliver on time, failure to deliver the right solution, failure to deliver the right quality and failure to keep to the budget.

One of the most common causes of all the above is uncontrolled change to the requirements and specifications. Many stakeholders don’t understand or see the need to analyse the effects of changes to the scope of a project and think that the project team can squeeze the additional effort into the time and costs. This is the ‘cant’ fit a quart into a pint pot’ analogy! Of course the project will overrun on its time and costs if change goes unchecked.

Therefore, every change to the scope (or breadth) of the project must have a full impact analysis prepared so that the project board may consider the change and approve, reject or defer it on sound business grounds. After all, they approved the scope to begin with so it is only right and proper that they get to review any changes to the baseline.

In the agile environment, changes to detail would be left in the hands of the project team members, guided by the business representative. However, even in the agile world, a change to the scope is still to be decided by the project board.


Definitions:

These are the definitions of Change Control, Change Management and Configuration Management.

In simple terms it means that the project board or change authority will ensure the change is the right thing to do based upon the project manager's impact analysis and the project requirements (Change Control).

Then the project manager would make sure the process by which amendments are made to outputs is followed with appropriate quality activities and that approvals are gained (Change Management).

All this may only happen if the outputs are identified, tracked and protected by recording details about them and their creation in some form of register or database (Configuration Management).

Change Control:
Critically evaluating each suggested change to ensure thatit is the right thing to do. It usually involves authority being vested in an individual or a board to make decisions about changes.

Change Management:
Ensuring that all elements that nee to be done to effect an approved change are done effectively.

Change Control and Change Management can be needed when no change to configuration e.g. change to milestones, resources, budget or schedule, update of project documents e.g. meeting minutes.

Configuration Management:
Activities required to ensure a configuration is created, maintained and accurate for any necessary assets.

Configuration Management can be required when no 'Change Management' needed e.g. like for like with different asset numbers, ay changes prior to baseline being established.


Stakeholder Engement

Projects are all about people. They want something changed, they develop the changes and they adopt and embed the change to deliver the benefits for the organization. 

Therefore, communication and engagement are paramount in ensuring the right things are done at the right time and that the final output(s) are what the business requires.


A Project Stakeholder is:

Any individual, group, or organisation that can affect, be affected by, or perceives itself to be affected by a project.
format_quote

This is a common definition from the programme and project methods that are prevalent today.  

Stakeholders come from all areas of the project community and almost all of them will have input to the solution and an impact on the delivery of the project. Therefore, we need to ensure we engage with them and communicate continuously and clearly.


Stakeholder Engagement:

Traditional Approaches focus on the early stages such as creating a vision, planning, finding energy to move forward and deciding on first steps.

Peter Senge (Dance of Change) looks for the longer-term issues of sustaining and renewing organisational change answering concerns such as:

    “We don’t have time for this stuff!”
    “We have no help!”
    “This stuff isn’t relevant!”
    “They’re not walking the talk!”

Peter Senge, director of the Center for Organizational Learning at the MIT Sloan School of Management.

Traditionally, much of the stakeholder engagement relating to change focuses on the early stages of the project such as creating a vision, planning, finding energy to move forward and deciding on first steps. They tend to look at the longer-term issues of sustaining and renewing organizational change. 

However, the approach taken by Peter Senge is noticeably different as he suggests that the difficulties with initiating change are to do with tackling these strong opposing forces:

    “We don’t have time for this stuff!” – People working on change initiatives will need extra time outside of the day to day to devote to change efforts, otherwise there will be push back.
    “We have no help!” – There will be new skills and mindsets to develop. People will need coaching and support to develop new capabilities.
    “This stuff isn’t relevant!” – Unless people are convinced of the need for effort to be invested, it will not happen.
    “They’re not walking the talk!” – People look for reinforcement of the new values or new behaviours from management.

If these are not addressed, there will be resistance to progress and the only way to address these issues is through engagement.


Logical, Rational Approach
priority_high

    Conduct a stakeholder analysis, identifying how each person/group should be approached
    Conduct an attitude/power analysis identifying any “groundwork” that needs to be done
    Determine your strategy & communication plan (participative, dictatorial etc.)
    Develop a creative implementation plan

There is a logical rational approach that implies there a point of stability at which the change begins. At this point, it is suggested that we can identify the project stakeholders and that they can be managed, and analysis done before the change is designed and implemented.

Some organisations lack that point of stability, so that it’s harder to get a firm footing as a start point which makes delivering change much harder.

Some stakeholders will, due to seniority, have power or influence over the outcome of your project. They may be supporters or blockers and therefore it is wise to capture this information on a power/influence grid to analyse the extent of their power and direction of influence.

Whatever the situation, change is going to be more difficult for some stakeholders than others. Therefore, the project needs an engagement strategy and a communication plan based on what we want from our stakeholders at certain points in the project. Do we need participation or do we want to dictate things at other points?

If the stakeholders are the recipients of a tsunami of emails (amusingly called ‘communication’) they will ultimately ‘switch off’ and hit the delete key on subsequent emails – probably at the point where you had something important for them to action! Be more creative! There are a load of useful communication tools and techniques available to PMs compared with ten years ago, so use them to their best effect. When email wasn’t part of everyday life, the PMs HAD to leave their desks and engage with stakeholders ‘eye-to-eye’, which provided them with so much more insight. Is it time to re-live the past a little?


Principles of Change:

It appears that humans don’t like change, which can be seen when projects are trying to deliver their outputs to the business for them to adopt and drive out the benefits.

There are many texts on the subject of change from strict procedural steps and checklists through to the human psychological condition.

However, change is dealt with by individuals in vastly different ways and at different pace.  This section of the workshop delves into some of the interesting aspects of change.


Tips for Successful Change (1):

    Effective sponsorship from top managers
    Buy-in from front-line managers and employees
    A clear picture (Vision) of the end state
    Continuous and targeted communication
    Well planned and organised approach – have a sequence 

Effective sponsorship is the key – top managers MUST walk the talk. If they don’t, the staff will most likely say, “They’re not changing, so why should we?”

Some roles emerge from research in this area such as:

    Vocal sponsor – who can be both positive and negative depending on their characteristics.
    Eager line managers – wanting to be ‘seen’ to be doing the ‘right’ thing or actually participating appropriately.
    Willing employees – again either willing because they value the change or just to be ‘seen’ to be willing.
    Skilled change managers – these are ‘people-people’ with all the right interpersonal and communication skills. They speak the language of the business and the operational employees. They are trusted and looked-to by those undergoing the changes.
    Savvy communicators – those who know not just what to say but when to say it and how to put the message across.
    Organised planners – the PMs and programme managers alongside their operational manager counterparts who know how to plan and adapt to constantly changing situations. 

These all seem to be important roles in the change process – and not always the same person.

Humans like to know where they are going, so having a clear picture of the end state and a plan of action with good communication along the way will help.


Tips for Successful Change (2):

    Re-affirmation of what needs to stop happening and what new behaviours are required 
    Encourage open discussion of the concerns, issues and risks 
    Help individuals discover the part they play in the new system & to take the first steps
    Create ‘quick wins’ and consolidate improvements quickly 
    Don’t denigrate the past but do celebrate progress towards the new future. 

Not all change ‘sticks’ first time so you may need to keep reminding people of the new ways of working and that they can’t step back into their old habits.

There will always be concerns and questions, so allow the stakeholders to have those discussions and if they centre round future roles, try to help them discover the part they will play. This alleviates a good deal of anxiety.

Sometimes we need to get the party started by announcing a ‘quick win’. This reminds everyone that the project is rolling and that the change is actually going to occur. It may also be necessary to provide the project with a benefit that can be built on for future phases.

Don't denigrate the past: "We recognise that the previous approach was relevant at the time and it was incredibly successful. But, the landscape has changed and we need to keep up with the needs of the present.”

If you denigrate the past, you denigrate those who built the past.

Therefore, a thin layer of critique wedged between two positives is always a good start.


Controlled Close 1:

During the controlled close, the project manager will evaluate the project in order to present the findings to the project board.


Controlled Close 2

The main activities of closing a project are:

    To gain acceptance of the projects final deliverables from the customer/client/users as well as the party that is going to support or maintain the solution once the project team has disbanded.
    To compile an End Project Report that contains the evaluation of the project as a whole with some statistical information based on the differences between the original PMP and the latest baselined version of the PMP. This allows the team as well as the organisation to assess how it did against its original estimates of time cost resources, tolerance, risk and change.
    To schedule a post project review in order to discuss the findings of the end project report, remembering to invite the right stakeholders and note the outcome of the project, not just in terms of the statistics, but also in terms of customer/client/user satisfaction.
    To assign any outstanding actions to the relevant and most appropriate area. Some risks will not have materialised but could still be on the horizon; some issues may have been set to one side to be dealt with after the project had closed; some requests for change may have been put into pending and need to go onto an 'upgrade' or 'amendments' list.
    To ensure that we learn our lessons from the project – the good the bad and the ugly - those things we did well (emulate them in the future); those we did badly (eradicate them from the future); those we got away with (try harder next time).
